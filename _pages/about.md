## Biography

I am a third-year PhD student advised by [Professor Christopher
Batten](http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~cbatten/) in Electrical and Computer
Engineering at Cornell University. I am part of the [Computer Systems Lab
(CSL)](http://www.csl.cornell.edu) at Cornell.

I am broady interested in computer architecture, parallel programming, and
parallel systems. Currently I am focusing on novel co-design techniques across
algorithm, runtime system, compiler and architecture layers in computer
system stack to build high-performance energy-efficient systems for
task-parallel applications.

Prior to joining Cornell, I received my Bachelors in Computer Science from
University of Mississippi in 2016. I worked as a research co-op at AMD Research
on modeling AMD's next-generate GPU's cache system in gem5 simulator in 2017.

Here is my [CV](files/tuan-ta-full-cv.pdf).
