## Biography

I am a final-year PhD student advised by [Professor Christopher
Batten](http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~cbatten/) in Electrical and Computer
Engineering at Cornell University. I am part of the [Computer Systems Lab
(CSL)](http://www.csl.cornell.edu) at Cornell.

My PhD research is focused on efficient parallel framework for heterogeneous
multi-/many-core systems and area-/power-efficient support for next-generation
vector architectures in mobile systems in chip.  Aside from that, I led a small
group of postdoc, PhD students, and undergraduates at Cornell University in a
heterogeneous many-cor/FPGA tapeout project in collaboration with a research
team from Princeton University.

Prior to joining Cornell, I received my Bachelors in Computer Science from
University of Mississippi in 2016. I worked as a research co-op at AMD Research
on modeling AMD's next-generation GPU's cache system and developing a cache
coherence testing framework in gem5 simulator in 2017. During my PhD, I
interned at Arm Research to explore wafer-scale many-core architecture and
Arm's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME).

I am currently looking for an industry research position starting in Summer
2023.

Here is my [CV](files/tuan-ta-full-cv.pdf) (Updated on 10/01/2022).
