## Biography

I am a CPU architect working on high-performance RISC-V processors at
[Tenstorrent](https://tenstorrent.com/). I received my Ph.D. degree in
Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University, advised by [Prof.
Christopher Batten](http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~cbatten/). My Ph.D. research
focused on efficient parallel framework for heterogeneous multi-/many-core
systems, area-/power-efficient support for next-generation vector
architectures, and sparse matrix computation on matrix architectures.

Prior to joining Cornell, I received my Bachelors in Computer Science from
University of Mississippi in 2016. I worked as a research co-op at AMD Research
on modeling AMD's next-generation GPU's cache system and developing a cache
coherence testing framework in gem5 simulator in 2017. During my PhD, I
interned at Arm Research to explore wafer-scale many-core architecture and
Arm's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME).

Here is my [CV](files/tuan-ta-full-cv.pdf) (Updated on 09/08/2024).
